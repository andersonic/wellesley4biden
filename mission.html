				<p>For optimal transparency, we have decided to release a statement describing what our goals as an organization are. As always, if you have any questions you can <a href="contact.html">contact us</a>. 
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li><span class="emphasized">Win the state of New Hampshire for Joe Biden.</span> We will be phone banking, canvassing (knocking on doors), registering voters, and doing what else the campaign needs us to do. This is our primary goal. We have decided to do this because New Hampshire is a swing state only 45 minutes from the Wellesley campus. Hillary barely won New Hampshire in 2016, beating Trump by a 0.04% margin, the second closest margin behind Michigan. Many political theorists and pollsters have predicted that winning New Hampshire is essential to beating Donald Trump in 2020.
					</li>
					<li><span class="emphasized">Win other important swing states for Joe Biden.</span> These include Colorado, Wisconsin, Arizona, Michigan, Texas, Minnesota, and others. We will be phone-banking and text-banking to help win these states.
					</li>
				</ol>
				
				<p>In addition to these points, we also recognize that politics is largely based on compromise. We can never assume an “all or nothing” mentality, because we will always end up with nothing. We also recognize that many political figures we respect have urged us, for the future of the country, to vote for Joe Biden in November.</p>

				<p>You will notice that nowhere in our goals statement have we expressed interest in changing the minds of Wellesley students or encouraging them to vote for Biden. We are focused on swing states, mainly New Hampshire. </p>

				<p>If you would like to join us, we are excited to welcome you. If you would like to join us anonymously, <a href="contact.html">contact</a> Lucy or Neeraja and we promise to protect your privacy.</p>
